I sat my [HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate][1] exam yesterday. I had been using Terraform over the last year, looking at ways of improving the speed and quality of the infrastructure builds on my last contract. Once again I decided to put my knowledge and experience into a certification.

The exam was remote-proctored and was quite straight-forward; the hardest part was probably the pre-exam part where I downloaded the secure browser to take the test on, took video of my desk, its surroundings, my ID and my wrists. The exam itself was quite straightforward after that! I received the emails with my certificate and notification from Credly about the issue of the badge almost immediately after finishing.
