Last April, we visited [Dive2gether][1], a PADI 5-Star IDC, to check out their facilities. Recently, while enjoying a beach day in Plakias with visiting relatives, we decided to book a couple of boat dives with them. Since we were bringing our own equipment, the dive center requested to test our BCDs and regulators to ensure everything was in top condition for safety.

We arrived at the dive center yesterday morning at 8:30 AM, where we were warmly introduced to our dive guides for the day; Linda, a member of the Marine Biology Research team, and Electra, who is currently part of Dive2gether's Bootcamp program. The dive center was bustling with activity, as they had a full schedule of boat dives, beach dives, and even a snorkeling trip. After a brief welcome meeting, we checked our gear, packed everything into personal crates, and made our way to the port.

At the boat, everyone pitched in to load the tanks, crates, and other essentials. Once our equipment was set up and we received a warm welcome from the boat captain, we introduced ourselves to the other divers and headed out to our first dive site.

Our first dive was at Willy’s Wall in Damnoni Bay. Afterward, we enjoyed a surface interval and lunch in Plakias Bay before diving Paligremnos Wall. The variety of marine life we encountered was incredible; we spotted sea slugs, groupers, rays, purple frilly Flabellina, plenty of lionfish, scorpionfish, and even a hermit crab. It was an unforgettable experience, and we’re already planning to return for more dives!

Upon returning to the port, everyone helped unload the equipment, and we quickly made our way back to Dive2gether to log our dives and reflect on the day's adventure.
