I sat my [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate][1] exam on Friday. I knew I had passed when I had finished, but I had to wait a couple of days for the score, my certificate and my badge.

I started working towards this certification over a year ago but various things got in the way of me taking the exam. When I realised the COVID-19 pandemic was going affect us all for a while, I decided to finish what I had started. It was then I discovered there was a new version of the exam (SAA-C02)!

I opted to restart the course and after a couple of weeks I felt I was ready. It was the hardest study work I've done for about 30 years, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and am delighted at the outcome.
