I started my Dive Industry Technicians Course (DITC) with [STATS 2000][1] in Morecambe today. There are three of us on the course: two divers, including myself, and another participant who works in a commercial diving environment.

The course is held in STATS 2000’s unique classroom and workshop. The building was originally one of 12 stables used for horses and carriages that once traveled along the promenade. Interestingly, this stable is numbered 13, as the blacksmith occupied number 1. The workshops — both for working and training — are located on the ground floor, while the classroom, kitchen, and office are housed in the former hayloft on the first floor.

Today’s session covered air composition, including the properties of its components, as well as key gas laws such as Boyle’s Law, the Ideal Gas Law, and the Kinetic Theory of Gases. We also went over the essential workshop tools and the basics of setting up a functional workspace.

Tomorrow promises to be more hands-on, with practical training on inspecting regulators (both 1st and 2nd Stages), buoyancy control devices (BCDs), and cylinders.

But first, homework!
