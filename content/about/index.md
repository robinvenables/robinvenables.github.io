I specialise in architecting, building, and managing physical, virtual, and cloud-based computing environments. My expertise centres around [IBM AIX][1] on [IBM POWER hardware][2] and [IBM PowerVS][3] in [IBM Cloud][4]. I have additional experience with various Linux variants including [Red Hat Enterprise Linux][5], [Ubuntu][6] and [Amazon Linux 2][7]. I bring extensive knowledge in the design, configuration, and support of storage management, backup, and clustering solutions, ensuring efficient and reliable IT infrastructures for my clients.

Away from work, I like to keep fit by walking the dog and running. After running the Silverstone Half and the Edinburgh Marathon in 2011, and the Silverstone Half again in 2015, I have entered the Crete Half Marathon in October. I haven't started my training plan yet but I run several 5km routes around the village and am a regular participant in the [Apokoronas Park Run][8] currently being held on the last Saturday of the month. It isn't an official Park Run event yet, but we are hoping to become the first in Greece. Over the winter (September - April) the start-time is 09:00 but in the summer it is 08:00 so we are finished before it gets too hot!

I am also a scuba diver. I began my diving journey in 2012 with [Oxford Dive Centre][9], and over the years, I’ve earned numerous PADI specialities, ultimately achieving the rating of [PADI Master Scuba Diver][10]. My early dives took place in cold, murky English quarries like [Vobster Quay][11] and [Stoney Cove][12], but since then, I’ve had the opportunity to explore much more inviting locations such as the Red Sea (both Egypt and Sudan), the Maldives, and Indonesia. Most recently, I’ve been diving around Crete, exploring both the north and south coasts, with many more dives planned for the future.

  Being defeated is often a temporary condition. Giving up is what makes it permanent.
